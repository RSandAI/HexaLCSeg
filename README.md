# HexaLCSeg
A Historical Benchmark Dataset from Hexagon Satellite Images for Land Cover Segmentation 
This repository demonstrates a novel open land cover benchmark dataset generated from historical Hexagon (KH-9) reconnaissance satellite images to be used in deep learning-based image segmentation task. 
The dataset, related source code, and pretrained models are available below.


Aim
---------------------

In this research, we generated a new benchmark dataset from VHR Worldview-3 images for twelve different LULC classes of two different geographical locations. We evaluated the performance of different segmentation architectures and encoders to find out the best solution to create highly accurate LULC maps.
