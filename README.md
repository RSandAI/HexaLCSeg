# HexaLCSeg
A Historical Benchmark Dataset from Hexagon Satellite Images for Land Cover Segmentation 
This repository demonstrates a novel open land cover benchmark dataset generated from historical Hexagon (KH-9) reconnaissance satellite images to be used in deep learning-based image segmentation task. 
The dataset, related source code, and pre-trained models are available below.

System-specific notes
---------------------
The code was implemented in Python(3.8) and PyTroch(1.14.0) on Windows OS. The *segmentation models pytorch* library is used as a baseline for implementation. Apart from main data science libraries, RS-specific libraries such as GDAL, rasterio, and tifffile are also required.
