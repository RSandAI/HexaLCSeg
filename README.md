# HexaLCSeg Benchmark Dataset

This study aims to emphasize the importance of historical land cover maps and introduce a new benchmark dataset derived from very high-resolution historical Hexagon (KH-9) reconnaissance satellite images for use in deep learning-based image segmentation tasks. Our HexaLCSeg dataset comprises high-resolution monochromatic Hexagon images from the 1970s and 1980s covering Turkish and Bulgarian territories, encompassing a large geographic area

The HexaLCSeg dataset comprises eight panchromatic images accompanied by corresponding 3-channel RGB Ground Truth Masks, all with 8-bit radiometric resolution and a spatial resolution of 1 meter. The dataset is organized into a total of 10,000 patches, each sized at 256x256 pixels. 
We split our dataset into 70% training (7000 patches), 15% validation (1500 patches), and 15% testing (1500 patches). 

Our dataset is inspired by the European Space Agency (ESA) WorldCover project and includes eight LC classes and related RGB codes were set for each class but we adjusted 0-pixel value as no data and replace the 0 values with 1 in ESA RGB code palette.
Additionally, a new sub-class for the trees, named Permanent Cropland is defined and its RGB code was set to 1-207-117. This class is important to differentiate permanent fruit trees from other trees, specifically crucial for past agricultural mapping purposes.

The dataset, related source code, and pre-trained models are available below.

System-specific notes
---------------------
The code was implemented in Python(3.8) and PyTroch(1.14.0) on Windows OS. The *segmentation models pytorch* library is used as a baseline for implementation. Apart from main data science libraries, RS-specific libraries such as GDAL, rasterio, and tifffile are also required.
